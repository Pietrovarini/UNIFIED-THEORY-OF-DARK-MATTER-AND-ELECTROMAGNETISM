UNIFIED THEORY OF DARK MATTER ANDELECTRTOMAGNETISM
Unified Theory of Electromagnetism and Dark Matter Pietro Varini October31, 2024
Abstract
This  theory  presents  a  unified  model  integrating  electromagnetism,dark matter, and fundamental interactions, using the Higgs field as a cru-cial link.  It explores the nature of dark matter as Higgs bosons and theirinteraction with the electromagnetic field. The objective is to demonstratehow these interactions can address existing issues in modern physics, suchas the nature of dark matter and the behavior of fundamental forces.1 
Introduction
Contemporary  physics  has  identified  three  fundamental  forces:   electromag-netism, weak interactions, and strong interactions.  However, the nature of darkmatter  and  its  interaction  with  these  forces  remain  an  enigma.   This  theoryseeks to bridge these gaps, proposing a model in which the Higgs field plays acentral role.2  Literature ReviewA  review  of  the  current  literature  reveals  various  approaches  to  understand-ing dark matter, including the WIMP hypothesis and modifications to gravity.However, these models often fail to explain certain phenomena observed in as-trophysics and cosmology.  This theory offers a fresh perspective by integratingelectromagnetism and the Higgs mechanism, addressing these shortcomings.
3  Theoretical Foundations3.1
Dark Matter as Higgs BosonsIt is proposed that dark matter consists of Higgs bosons.  These bosons not onlyconfer mass to particles via the Higgs mechanism but also interact with elec-1
tromagnetic fields, creating a link between dark matter and electromagnetism.The fundamental relationship is described by the equation:m=g·v,(1)wheremrepresents the particle’s mass,gis the coupling factor,  andvis thevacuum expectation value of the Higgs field.
3.2  Electromagnetism and Quantum FluctuationsThe electromagnetic field is described by Maxwell’s equations:∇2E=μ0ε0∂2E∂t2.(2)This theory suggests that fluctuations in the Higgs field can generate electro-magnetic waves, influencing the behavior of particles and fundamental forces.3.3  Field InteractionsField dynamics can be described through a unified Lagrangian:L=12(∂μH)2−V(H) +14FμνFμν+gH ̄ψψ+i ̄ψγμDμψ−mψ ̄ψψ.(3)Components of the Lagrangian:1.Higgs Field Term:V(H) =λH2−v222.Electromagnetic Field Tensor:Describes the dynamics of electromag-netism.3.Higgs-Matter Interaction:The Yukawa interaction that gives mass toparticles.4.Fermionic Field:Describes the behavior of fermions and their interac-tion with electromagnetic fields.
4  Mathematical Validation4.1  Higgs MechanismWe  validate  the  Higgs  mechanism.   When  the  Higgs  field  acquires  a  vacuumexpectation value, the Yukawa term becomes:mψ=gv.(4)4.2  Electromagnetic Coherence We verify the coherence of the electromagnetic field.  From the Lagrangian, wederive  Maxwell’s  equations,  demonstrating  that  the  theory  is  consistent  withclassical physics.2
4.3  Matter-Antimatter PolarizationThe behavior of matter and antimatter is described by the Dirac equation:(iγμDμ−m)ψ= 0.(5)Positive  and  negative  solutions  respectively  represent  matter  and  antimatter,supporting our interpretation.
4.4  Black Holes as Electromagnetic VorticesUsing the Einstein-Maxwell equations, we demonstrate that black holes can beconsidered electromagnetic vortices.  The solutions suggest significant electro-magnetic interactions in the presence of gravity.
5  Cosmological ImplicationsThe theory suggests that the universe may be described by a toroidal structureinfluenced by interactions between Higgs bosons and electromagnetic fields.  Thetoroidal metric tensor can be written as:ds2=−c2dt2+a(t)2dr2+r2dθ2+r2sin2θdφ2.(6)
This model is consistent with cosmological observations and can be integratedwith Friedmann’s equations.6  Future DirectionsFuture  research  should  focus  on  experimentally  validating  these  predictions,particularly regarding cosmological phenomena and field interactions.  Potentialexperiments  could  involve  collider  data  to  search  for  Higgs  bosons  and  theirelectromagnetic interactions, as well as astrophysical observations to probe darkmatter’s nature.7  ConclusionThe proposed unified theory offers a coherent framework for understanding darkmatter,  electromagnetism,  and  fundamental  interactions.   By  addressing  theshortcomings of existing models and providing mathematical validations,  thistheory opens up new avenues for research in fundamental physics
